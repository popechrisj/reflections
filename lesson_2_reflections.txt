What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A new folder, .git, is created to track 
	changes made to your project so that you 
	can compare different versions of your project. 
	A repository receives any future commits 
	that you make to the project. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is the temporary location 
	before the file has been committed from the 
	working directory to the repository. It allows 
	you to decide which files you would like to 
	commit rather than committing every single 
	file. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    A logical change can affect one or more files. 
	Each affected file can be added  to the staging 
	area individually, and all files can be committed 
	at once. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    Branches would be helpful when creating a new 
	version of code with an experimental feature. 
	Branches preserve the original version of code 
	and allow both versions to be accessible. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    The diagrams illustrate how branches relate to 
	one another and how changes made to each branch 
	are seen (or not seen) by other branches. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    The result is the combined code of the two previous 
	branches referenced against the point where the 
	branches split apart. 

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
