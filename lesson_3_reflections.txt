When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating, working on different computers, 
    and backing up the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If Git stayed up-to-date automatically, then it could 
	make changes unexpectedly or update before changes 
	are ready to be included.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - other user's repository that you would like to 
	modify but do not have permission to change. Fork 
	clones a repository on GitHub and allows modifications 
	to be made publically even though you cannot modify 
	the original. 
	
	Clone - makes a copy of a repository anywhere and can 
	modify locally. 
	
	Branch - change to a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
	allows you to see what changes have been made by 
	your collaborators since last copying. You can also 
	merge while offline if you are working without 
	internet access. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using google docs so that the changes could be made 
	by multiple people. I would also be able to see who 
	made which changes. The drawback would be that people 
	could work on the same parts of the code and mess up 
	the other person's work. This solution also would 
	allow more bugs to occure in the code. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
